# 2023 Portland Rent Board Annual Report Data Analysis

This repository contains my work contributing to the Annual Report for the Portland, ME Rent Board. The data and figures in this repository should NOT be considered official. I am making my code available to the public in the hope that it might help others interested in working with the City's rental registration data.

If you have questions or comments directed at the outcomes of this analysis or, more generally, the Portland Rent Board, please email portlandrentboard@gmail.com. For all other questions, I can be reached at pemRBD5@proton.me.
